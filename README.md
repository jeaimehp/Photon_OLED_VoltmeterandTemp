# Photon_OLED Voltmeter and twin Temperature Sensors
This is a sensor to I built to monitor temperature(ambient and localized), current (amps), voltage(v). It was specifically constructed to monitor a sample sap flux sensor used  to monitor vegetation sap flow.

Parts:

1. Particle Photon
2. Sparkfun Phonton OLED Shield
3. Max471 / GY471 Current Sensor
4. NTC 3950 thermistor 100K Ohm
5. DS18B20 Digital Temperature Sensor 
6. 10K Ohm Resistor
7. 3x 100K Ohm Resistors
8. 3.3K Ohm Resistor
9. 470K Ohm Resistor
10. 330K Ohm Resistor
11. Bread Board
12. Many Jumpers
